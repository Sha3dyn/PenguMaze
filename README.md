# PenguMaze
My first game project. I'm still very new to programming and game designing, so it's not perfect. But I'm learning.

About the game:
- Move with arrow keys
- Collect 3 hidden baby penguins from each level
- The idea of this game comes from old Pok√©mon games' ice caverns. Ground is ice. If you press an arrow key, you start to slide
  over to the next solid object. You can't change direction during sliding. You need to use objects in levels to get where you
  need to go.
- Second level has multiple teleports that you need to use to find baby penguins.
